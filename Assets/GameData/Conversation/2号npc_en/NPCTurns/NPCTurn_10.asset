  text: When you're with someone, do you prefer doing outdoor activities, or staying
    in more?
  playerChoices:
  - textPrompt: Homebody
    textLine: Since I'm a homebody myself, I hope my partner is similar to me.
    npcResponse: Hmm, like snuggling together and watching dramas or playing games?
  - textPrompt: Outdoorsy
    textLine: If both of us are free, it would be better to go out for a stroll together.
    npcResponse: Well, there are probably more options for outdoor activities.
  - textPrompt: It doesn't matter
    textLine: I'm fine, it depends on what the other person wants to do!
    npcResponse: Hmm, cool.
