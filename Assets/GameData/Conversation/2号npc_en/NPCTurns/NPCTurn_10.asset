  text: When interacting with others, do you prefer someone who is outdoorsy or someone
    who is homebody?
  playerChoices:
  - textPrompt: Homebody
    textLine: Since I'm a homebody myself, I hope my partner is similar to me.
    npcResponse: Hmm, is it okay if we can snuggle together and watch dramas or play
      games?
  - textPrompt: Outdoorsy
    textLine: If both of you are free, it would be better to go out for a stroll
      together.
    npcResponse: Well, there are probably more options for outdoor activities.
  - textPrompt: It doesn't matter
    textLine: I'm fine, it depends on what the other person wants to do!
    npcResponse: Hmm, should we give the choice to the other party?
