  playerTopic:
    textPrompt: Is it a long-lasting affection or just a fleeting infatuation?
    textLine: Do you tend to be passionate about hobbies for a long time, or do you
      often only have a fleeting interest?
    npcResponse: I'm probably the latter, right? The cycle is about a year; I might
      like this anime this year, but I might switch next year.
