  text: Forgive my bluntness, but do you consider aesthetic taste a prerequisite
    for any meaningful connection?
  playerChoices:
  - textPrompt: Yes
    textLine: Honestly, I find it pretty hard to be friends with people who aren't
      on the same page as me, aesthetically.
    npcResponse: So, you're looking for "aesthetic compatibility", then. I get that.
  - textPrompt: No
    textLine: No, aesthetics is a very subjective thing.
    npcResponse: You must be a very tolerant person.
