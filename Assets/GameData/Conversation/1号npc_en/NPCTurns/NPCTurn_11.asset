  text: Where do you usually hang out in the city?
  playerChoices:
  - textPrompt: Bar
    textLine: Bars are lively and crowded.
    npcResponse: I have a funny friend who actually goes to bars just to listen to
      music.
  - textPrompt: bookstore
    textLine: Bookstores are way quieter. I usually go there to work on my papers
      or just browse.
    npcResponse: Ah, spoken like a true academic!
  - textPrompt: Amusement park
    textLine: I love going to amusement parks with friends. I even got an annual
      pass just to wait in line for the interactive rides.
    npcResponse: Don't you think that "role-playing" has a strong philosophical undertone?
