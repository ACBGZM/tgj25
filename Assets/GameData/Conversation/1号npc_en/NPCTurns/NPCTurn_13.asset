  text: This cafe is actually just average in quality; it relies entirely on marketing.
    Random question, but... how do you feel about consumerism?
  playerChoices:
  - textPrompt: Bad thing
    textLine: It made me very sensitive and vigilant.
    npcResponse: Hmm...a feeling of being coerced?
  - textPrompt: Hallucination
    textLine: Just like how the two of us ultimately chose this cafe.
    npcResponse: Yeah, you can't really escape it.
  - textPrompt: No thoughts
    textLine: Honestly, I'm just one person. I don't really have much to say about
      the "big picture".
    npcResponse: Maybe the more self-aware we become, the more it hurts?
