  text: 'Since we may be spending more time together in the future, I''d like to
    ask you which do you think is more important: differences or commonalities between
    two people?'
  playerChoices:
  - textPrompt: Differences
    textLine: Differences are what create the desire to communicate, right? And wouldn't
      it be terrifying if two people were exactly the same, like looking in a mirror?
    npcResponse: Upon closer examination, no two people are exactly alike.
  - textPrompt: Commonalities
    textLine: We need to have something in common to be able to have fun together.
    npcResponse: We only notice each other when our paths cross.
