  text: 'Since we''ll probably be seeing more of each other, I''ve been wondering...
    what do you think matters more: how we''re different, or what we have in common?'
  playerChoices:
  - textPrompt: Differences
    textLine: Differences are what create the desire to communicate, right? And wouldn't
      it be terrifying if two people were exactly the same, like looking in a mirror?
    npcResponse: If you look closely enough, no two people are ever really the same
      anyway.
  - textPrompt: Commonalities
    textLine: We need to have some common ground to actually enjoy being together,
      don't you think?
    npcResponse: We only notice each other when our paths cross.
