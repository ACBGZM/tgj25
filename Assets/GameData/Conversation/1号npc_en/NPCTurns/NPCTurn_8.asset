  text: Have you ever been to an immersive theater performance? I'm curious about
    your thoughts on this format.
  playerChoices:
  - textPrompt: Enjoy
    textLine: Domestically, I quite like Sleep No More and Stolen Heart.
    npcResponse: Oh, those two are indeed quite famous in mainland China.
  - textPrompt: Dislike
    textLine: I don't watch much theater, and immersive theater feels a bit like
      a novelty to me.
    npcResponse: Yes, domestic dramas are a bit too formalistic.
