  text: Have you experienced immersive theater? I'm curious if you find the medium
    truly avant-garde or just gimmicky.
  playerChoices:
  - textPrompt: Like
    textLine: Back home, I quite like Sleep No More and Stolen Heart.
    npcResponse: Oh, those two are indeed quite famous in mainland China.
  - textPrompt: Dislike
    textLine: I don't really go to the theater much, so immersive stuff feels like
      a bit of a gimmick to me.
    npcResponse: "yeah, a lot of domestic plays feel a bit\u2026 formalistic."
