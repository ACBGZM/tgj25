    who I really am. Do you ever get into those weird, deep headspaces?"
  playerChoices:
  - textPrompt: Me too
    textLine: I get that. But honestly, I think it's fine to just accept that we're
      pretty ordinary.
    npcResponse: Don't have too many expectations of ourselves.
  - textPrompt: No
    textLine: Not really. I don't really do 'inner conflict'.Rather than reflecting
      on myself, I tend to blame others.
    npcResponse: Haha, I wish I had your mindset. You're so chill.
