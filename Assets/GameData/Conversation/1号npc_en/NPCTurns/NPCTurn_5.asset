  text: Do you usually enjoy watching movies?
  playerChoices:
  - textPrompt: YES
    textLine: I like both theatrical releases and niche films.
    npcResponse: I quite like Tarkovsky's films.
  - textPrompt: NO
    textLine: Well, actually I'm not particularly interested in movies, but if a
      friend asks me to watch one with them, that's fine with me.
    npcResponse: Oh, I see.
  - textPrompt: No particular preference
    textLine: I don't have any particular preference for movies. I might buy tickets
      to see a movie that's popular online or has good reviews.
    npcResponse: I think most people are like that.
