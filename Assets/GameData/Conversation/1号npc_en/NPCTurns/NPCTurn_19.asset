  text: "Can I ask you something a bit clich\xE9? Do you believe in love at first
    sight?"
  playerChoices:
  - textPrompt: Yes
    textLine: I know it's a typical answer, but I've always felt like there's something
      out there... you know, guiding us toward certain people.
    npcResponse: So... that's a yes, then?
  - textPrompt: I don't believe
    textLine: Uh, don't you think falling in love at first sight is just a fancy
      way of saying you like their face?
    npcResponse: Fair enough.
