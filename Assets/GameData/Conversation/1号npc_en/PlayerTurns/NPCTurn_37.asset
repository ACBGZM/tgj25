    textPrompt: Do you prefer nature or the city?
    textLine: "Although we are all caught up in the city now, it may be a bit pointless
      to ask this question\u2014do you prefer the atmosphere of the city or the feeling
      of nature in the countryside?"
    npcResponse: If I had the chance, I would settle in the countryside, where things
      that are natural and unpretentious would make me feel more relaxed.
