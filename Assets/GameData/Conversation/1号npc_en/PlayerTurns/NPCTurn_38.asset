    textPrompt: Do you often reminisce about your childhood?
    textLine: I think some things that happen in childhood have a great influence
      on the shaping of personality and behavioral logic. Do you often think about
      your childhood?
    npcResponse: Yeah, but honestly? Only the messy parts stick. Like the memory
      of my dad slapping me.
