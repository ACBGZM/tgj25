  text: When you meet someone for the first time, what factors do you usually consider
    to decide whether or not to continue the relationship?
  playerChoices:
  - textPrompt: Character
    textLine: It's definitely about character, although you might not be able to
      tell immediately.
    npcResponse: After all, it was our first meeting.
  - textPrompt: Personality
    textLine: It's about personality. If your personalities don't match, you can't
      even have a proper conversation.
    npcResponse: So we don't have any personality clashes?
