  text: When a disagreement arises with your partner, do you prefer to address it
    directly, or to ake some time to process it first?
  playerChoices:
  - textPrompt: Face to face.
    textLine: Address the issue face-to-face immediately. Many relationships are
      difficult to repair once the optimal time has passed.
    npcResponse: Of course, irreparable is the worst-case scenario...
  - textPrompt: Talk after we calm down
    textLine: Let's calm down first. Maybe after a while we'll both realize there's
      No need to argue.
    npcResponse: This is also to avoid conflict.
