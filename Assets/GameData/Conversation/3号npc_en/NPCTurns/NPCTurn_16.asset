  text: Would it annoy you if a partner held a different perspective on certain things?
    I'd love to know your thoughts on that.
  playerChoices:
  - textPrompt: Yes
    textLine: I'm quite concerned about this because it could lead to arguments.
    npcResponse: Hmm... if both feel this is an important topic.
  - textPrompt: No
    textLine: I don't mind; it's impossible for everyone to think exactly the same

    npcResponse: It's impossible for them to be exactly the same.
  - textPrompt: It depends
    textLine: "It depends... I may be very concerned about issues involving values
      \u200B\u200Band beliefs."
    npcResponse: Hmm... having similiar values is very important.
